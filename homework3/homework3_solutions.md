### Task 1
For this task, we were asked to implement a method that returns the absolute error in the approximation of one vector by another when the 2-norm is used.

- Code:
  - [abs_error_2norm.py](Task1/abs_error_2norm.py)
- Software Manual entry:
  - [abs_error_2norm](../software_manual/abs_error_2norm/abs_error_2norm.md)

### Task 2
For this task, we were asked to implement a method that returns the absolute error in the approximation of one vector by another when the 1-norm is used

- Code:
  - [abs_error_1norm.py](Task2/abs_error_1norm.py)
- Software Manual entry:
  - [abs_error_1norm](../software_manual/abs_error_1norm/abs_error_1norm.md)

### Task 3
For this task, we were asked to implement a method that returns the absolute error in the approximation of one vector by another when the ∞-norm is used

- Code:
  - [abs_error_infnorm.py](Task3/abs_error_infnorm.py)
- Software Manual entry:
  - [abs_error_infnorm](../software_manual/abs_error_infnorm/abs_error_infnorm.md)

### Task 4
For this task, we were asked to implement a method that returns the 1-matrix norm of a given square matrix.

- Code:
  - [vector_1norm.py](Task4/vector_1norm.py)
- Software Manual entry:
  - [vector_1norm](../software_manual/vector_1norm/vector_1norm.md)

### Task 5

- Code:
  - [vector_infnorm.py](Task5/vector_infnorm.py)
- Software Manual entry:
  - [vector_infnorm](../software_manual/vector_infnorm/vector_infnorm.md)

### Task 6
For this task, we were asked to implement a method that returns the dot produce of two vectors of the same length.

- Code:
  - [vector_dot.py](Task6/vector_dot.py)
- Software Manual entry:
  - [vector_dot](../software_manual/vector_dot/vector_dot.md)

### Task 7
For this task, we were asked to implement a method that returns the cross-product of two vectors of length three.

- Code:
  - [vector_cross.py](Task7/vector_cross.py)
- Software Manual entry:
  - [vector_cross](../software_manual/vector_cross/vector_cross.md)

### Task 8
For this task, we were asked to implement a method that returns the product of two matrices with an equal inner dimension.

- Code:
  - [matrix_mult.py](Task8/matrix_mult.py)
- Software Manual entry:
  - [matrix_mult](../software_manual/matrix_mult/matrix_mult.md)

### Task 9
For this task, we were asked to write a routine that will generate a diagonally dominant matrix that has real values in all entries of the matrix.

- Code:
  - [gen_diagdom_matrix.py](Task9/gen_diagdom_matrix.py)
- Software Manual entry:
  - [gen_diagdom_matrix](../software_manual/gen_diagdom_matrix/gen_diagdom_matrix.md)

### Task 10
For this task, we were asked to search the internet for sites that define and discuss the Frobenius matrix norm, and also look for sites that define consistent matrix norms.

The Frobenius matrix norm (also known as the Euclidian norm) is a matrix norm defined as the square root of the sum of the absolute squares of its elements. It is analogous to calculating the magnitude of a vector by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of its elements. The Frobenius matrix is also analogous to calculating the 2-norm of a vector.  <br>
Not all matrices are consistent. A matrix norm is called consistent with a vector norm on Km if ||Ax ||a ≤ ||A|| ||x||a. The Frobenius norm is an example of a consistant norm, as well as the operator norm and the p matrix norm. <br>
