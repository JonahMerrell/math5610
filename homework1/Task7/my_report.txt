When I ran the hello.exe file on one of the computers in the Engineering computer lab, I got the following result printed:


 ./hello.exe
 hello world from thread           4
 hello world from thread           2
 hello world from thread           6
 hello world from thread           5
 hello world from thread           1
 hello world from thread           7
 hello world from thread           3
 hello world from thread           0
 There are           8  threads!

This means that there are 8 cores on the computer.
