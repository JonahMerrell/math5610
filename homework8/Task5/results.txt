The method can potentially find all of the eigenvectors for a matrix, as long as those eignvectors are "conviniently" placed. If the eigenvectors are clustered too close together, than the method will fail to identity all of them. Also, if a shift value is chosen too close to the exact middle of 2 eigenvalues, then the method's current max iteration count may not be enough to allow convergence, even if it outherwise would. Finally, I found that when a matrix has 2 eigenvalues of equal magnitude but opposite signs, then it would often only be able to converge on of them.
