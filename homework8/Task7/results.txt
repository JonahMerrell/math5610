This algorithm for computing an aproximation for the condition number of a matrix function very similarly to the "matrix_condition_number" routine made for task 3. The "matrix_condition_number" algorithm uses the power iteration method to compute the largest eigenvalue, while this method uses the Rayleigh Quotient algorithm to compute the largest eigenvalue. Since a starting eigenvalue can not be specified for the Rayleigh Quotient algorithm (Since this algorthm choses the shifting value for you during run-time), this means that I was not able to use this algorthm to substitute the Inverse Iteration method instead (which is used to compute the smallest eigenvalue).When tested on a 10x10 hilbert matrix, the routine accuratly produced the same results as before: 16024243403150.434. (previously calcualted from task 4)
